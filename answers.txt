Steps to add MinMaxCalculation.java file
  Change to branch master: git branch master
  First create the file: touch MinMaxCalculation.java
  Edit and save the file to add the code
  Stage the change: git add MinMaxCalculation.java
  Commit the changes: git commit -m "add MinMaxCalculation"
  Pull any new remote commit: git pull
  Resolve any conflicts
  Git push the commits: git push 
In the context of collaborative development, merge should be done locally and if possible on another branch to keep the master branch clean. This is to keep the conflict resolve process separated from the code development.
Then it can be merge back into the master branch. Everythings commits or conflict resolved should be commented clearly to allow for others to understand the work you are doing.
There should be a commit and branch naming conventions that everyone in the team adheres to to keep the git history clean and well organized. It would make searching for a specific commit easier.
For example, commit and branches could be something like [actions/description] with actions being the goal of the commit or the branch like development or bug fixing, 
and description is to provide an overall view of the commit or branch.
We can also use .gitignore file to ignore certain files during your commit so changes to those files will not be recorded. This could be useful in the case of 
environment files that should not be public or build files of the project.
